# Advent of Code

`Advent of Code` is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

This package allows me to solve various problems in languages that I master or wish to master.
